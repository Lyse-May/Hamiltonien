Lab 1 : 
    
An investor has a fund. It has 1 million euros at time zero. It pays 5% interest per year for T=50
years. The investor cannot withdraw the invested money. But, (s)he consumes a proportion (at)
of the interest at time t and reinvests the rest. What should the investor do to maximize the
consumption before T ?
